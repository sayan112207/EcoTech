# PM2.5 Prediction Project
Data Analysis of PM2.5 levels over time and the performance of machine learning models for predicting PM2.5 levels.

## Data Visualization

The Image folder contains two images:

## Machine Learning Models

The following machine learning models were used for prediction:

* AutoRegressive Model

* MLP Regressor
  ![MLP Regressor](https://github.com/sayan112207/EcoTech/blob/main/Images/Air%20Pollution/NN%20MLPRegressor%20Model.png?raw=true)

The performance of each model was evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MSE).
