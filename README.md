# PM2.5 Prediction Project
Data Analysis of PM2.5 levels over time and the performance of machine learning models for predicting PM2.5 levels.

## Data Visualization

The Image folder contains two images:

* `PM time Series.png`: This image shows the PM2.5 levels over a prolonged time-period.
* `PM vs month bar.png`: This image shows the PM2.5 levels vs Month
* `PM vs year bar.png`: This image shows the PM2.5 levels vs Year
* `AutoRegressive Model.png`: This image shows the performance of the Auto Regression Model for predicting PM2.5 levels.
* `Explainable Boosting Model.png`: This image shows the performance of the ML Model: Explainable Boosting Machine for predicting PM2.5 levels.
* `RandomForestRegressor Model.png`: This image shows the performance of the Random Forest Regressor Model for predicitng PM2.5 levels.
* `NN MLPRegressor Model.png`: This image shows the performance of the Neural Networks Model for predicting PM2.5 levels.

## Machine Learning Models

The following machine learning models were used for prediction:

* AutoRegressive Model
* Explainable Boosting Model
* Random forest
* MLP Regressor

The performance of each model was evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MSE).

## Instructions

To run the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

### Step 1: Run the .ipynb file
### Step 2: Run the command python app.py


```

This will create the data visualization images.

```


I hope this helps!
